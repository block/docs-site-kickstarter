## FAQItem Interface

```typescript
interface FAQItem {
  question: string;  // The question text (required)
  answer: string;    // The answer text (required)
  id?: string;       // Optional unique identifier
}
```

## Layout Options

### Single Column Layout
Best for most use cases with a clean, focused design:
- All questions in one column
- Easy to scan and read
- Works well with any number of questions

```tsx
<FAQSection layout="single" faqs={faqs} />
```

### Two-Column Layout
Great for organizing many questions or creating visual balance:
- Questions distributed across two columns
- Better use of horizontal space
- Ideal for 6+ questions

```tsx
<FAQSection layout="two-column" faqs={faqs} />
```

## Visual Variants

### Default Variant
Clean card-based design with subtle shadows and borders:

```tsx
<FAQSection variant="default" faqs={faqs} />
```

### Bordered Variant
Minimal design with borders but no background fill:

```tsx
<FAQSection variant="bordered" faqs={faqs} />
```

### Minimal Variant
Ultra-clean design with just bottom borders:

```tsx
<FAQSection variant="minimal" faqs={faqs} />
```

## Behavior Options

### Single Open Item (Default)
Only one FAQ can be open at a time - opening another closes the previous:

```tsx
<FAQSection allowMultiple={false} faqs={faqs} />
```

### Multiple Open Items
Users can open multiple FAQs simultaneously:

```tsx
<FAQSection allowMultiple={true} faqs={faqs} />
```

## Custom Content

Use the slot to add additional content like contact information or CTAs:

```tsx
<FAQSection title="Common Questions" faqs={faqs}>
  <div class="faq-contact">
    <h3>Need more help?</h3>
    <p>Our support team is available 24/7 to assist you.</p>
    <a href="/support" class="faq-contact-button">
      Get Support
    </a>
  </div>
</FAQSection>
```

- **ARIA Attributes**: Proper `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` attributes
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML structure for assistive technologies
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

  --faq-border-radius: 0.75rem;

}
```

### Custom Styling

    .custom-faq .faq-question {
      background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
      color: white;
    }
  </style>
</FAQSection>
```

## Best Practices

1. **Question Writing**: Use clear, specific questions that users actually ask
2. **Answer Length**: Keep answers concise but complete (2-4 sentences ideal)
3. **Organization**: Group related questions together
4. **Search Integration**: Consider adding search functionality for many FAQs
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep content current and add new questions based on user feedback

## Common Use Cases

- **Product Documentation**: Feature explanations and troubleshooting
- **Support Pages**: Customer service and technical support
- **Onboarding**: New user questions and getting started guides
- **Pricing Pages**: Billing, plans, and feature questions
- **Legal Pages**: Terms, privacy, and compliance questions

## Integration with Search

For sites with many FAQs, consider adding search functionality:

```tsx
<!-- Add search before FAQ section -->
<div class="faq-search">
  <input type="search" placeholder="Search FAQs..." />
</div>

<FAQSection faqs={filteredFaqs} />
```

## Analytics and Optimization

Track which questions are most frequently opened to:
- Identify common user pain points
- Optimize question ordering
- Create additional documentation for popular topics
- Improve product features based on common questions

## Content Management

### Static Content
```tsx
const faqs = [
  { question: "...", answer: "..." },
  // ... more FAQs
];
```

### Dynamic Content
```tsx
// Fetch from CMS or API
const faqs = await fetch('/api/faqs').then(res => res.json());
```

### Markdown Support
```tsx
const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How do I format code?",
    answer: "Use backticks for `inline code` or triple backticks for code blocks."
  }
];
```
