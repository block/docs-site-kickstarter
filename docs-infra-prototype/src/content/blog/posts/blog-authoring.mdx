This guide will walk you through writing a new blog post. 

## Writing a Blog Post

Alert: This is a work in progress as we build out the blog system. - ALR

### Add Yourself as an Author

Alert: This only needs to be done once, before your first post.

#### Add Your Avatar

Find a great headshot or other picture you'd like to use as your avatar. Put it in `src/assets/blog/avatars`:

#### Add Author Metadata

Open `src/content/blog/authors.json` in a file editor.

Add an entry for yourself, following the format:

```javascript
    {
    "alrubinger" : {
        "name": "Andrew Lee Rubinger",
        "title": "Lead, Open Source Program Office, Block",
        "social-github": "ALRubinger",
        "social-linkedin": "alrubinger",
        "social-x": "ALRubinger",
        "avatar" : "alrubinger.jpg"
    }
    ...more
    }
```

This is the schema:

| Property  | Description and Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
|-----------|-----------------------|
| `id` | Unique ID for you; this is what you'll put in the metadata of your blog entries when you write an post. |
| `author` | The the key of the author in `./src/content/blog/authors.yaml` - defines who wrote the post |
| `title` | Your job title. What would you say...you *do* here? |
| `social-github` | Your GitHub username |
| `social-LinkedIn` | Your LinkedIn username |
| `social-x` | Your X, formerly Twitter, username |
| `avatar` | Location of your avatar image within `src/assets/blog/avatars`; accepts any file format `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, or `.gif`. |

### Make a File for your Blog Post

Create a new `.mdx` file in `/src/content/blog/posts`:

In this example, the URL of the blog post will be `http(s)://<$domain>/<$baseURL>/blog/my-post`. 
URL Routing is determined by the filename without the `.mdx` extension. So choose your filename 
with its target URL in mind.

### Add Metadata

At the top of the file you've just created, add 
"[frontmatter](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/)", a series of 
metadata wrapped in `---` above and below. For instance:

```bash theme="terminal" title="/src/blog/my-post.mdx"

---
title: Title of my blog post
author: alrubinger
date: 2025-03-22
---

```

The following properties apply, and they are defined in `/src/content/config.ts`:

{/* This table in HTML rather than Markdown so we have control over wrapping */}
<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
        <th class="whitespace-nowrap">Property</th>
        <th class="whitespace-nowrap">Required</th>
        <th class="whitespace-nowrap">Description and Notes</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap"><code>title</code></td>
        <td>✅</td>
        <td>The title of the blog post.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap"><code>author</code></td>
        <td>✅</td>
        <td>The key of the author in <code>./src/content/blog/authors.json</code> – defines who wrote the post.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap"><code>date</code></td>
        <td>✅</td>
        <td>Date in <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html">ISO 8601</a> or short-form <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> format. The short form is acceptable because the formatting the docs system uses will drop precision and only show the day and date of the post, leaving off the time.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap"><code>excerpt</code></td>
        <td></td>
        <td>A short summary or description of the post, shown in blog indexes. If not provided, an excerpt from the body will be used.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap"><code>image</code></td>
        <td></td>
        <td>Path to a hero image for the post, e.g. <code>/blog/[authorName]/my-image.png</code>. This file should be located in <code>/public/blog/[authorName]</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap"><code>tags</code></td>
        <td></td>
        <td>An array of tags for the post, e.g. <code>["react", "nextjs"]</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td class="whitespace-nowrap"><code>readTime</code></td>
        <td></td>
        <td>An estimated amount of time it takes to read this post, e.g. <code>10 minutes</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>


Alert: This section on frontmatter properties will evolve as we build out the schema for blog posts. - ALR

### Write your Post

Blog Posts are written in Markdown, and because it's a full MDX format, this supports all
dynamic content available to Astro or any of the rest of the docs system as shown in the examples.
