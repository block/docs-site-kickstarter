    <h2>Block's Significant Open Source Contributions</h2>
    <p>Block has a deep and sustained commitment to open source, contributing to foundational technologies that power our products and the broader developer ecosystem. Our involvement spans across infrastructure, developer tooling, security, and financial innovation, with contributions to both widely adopted community projects and highly specialized tools. From contributions to software ecosystems like MySQL, Android, and Bitcoin to advancing developer productivity and cloud infrastructure with gRPC, Envoy, and LeakCanary, our work has had a lasting impact. Our philosophy is not only about using open source but actively giving back and shaping itâ€”enhancing projects we depend on and sharing our own innovations with the world. This approach aligns with our mission of economic empowerment by fostering transparency, security, and accessibility in technology.</p>
