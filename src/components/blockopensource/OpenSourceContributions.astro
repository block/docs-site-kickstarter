  title="Block's Significant Open Source Contributions"
  subtitle="Key Contributions"
  externalLinks={keyContributions}>
    Block has a deep and sustained commitment to open source, contributing to 
    foundational technologies that power our products and the broader developer ecosystem. 
    Our involvement spans across infrastructure, developer tooling, security, and financial 
    innovation, with contributions to both widely adopted community projects and highly 
    specialized tools. From contributions to software ecosystems like MySQL, Android, and 
    Bitcoin to advancing developer productivity and cloud infrastructure with gRPC, Envoy, 
    and LeakCanary, our work has had a lasting impact. Our philosophy is not only about using 
    open source but actively giving back and shaping itâ€”enhancing projects we depend on and 
    sharing our own innovations with the world. This approach aligns with our mission of 
    economic empowerment by fostering transparency, security, and accessibility in technology.
