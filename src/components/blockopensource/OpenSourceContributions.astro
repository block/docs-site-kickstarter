    <h2 class="mt-0">Block's Significant Open Source Contributions</h2>
    <p>
      Block has a deep and sustained commitment to open source, contributing to 
      foundational technologies that power our products and the broader developer ecosystem. 
      Our involvement spans across infrastructure, developer tooling, security, and financial 
      innovation, with contributions to both widely adopted community projects and highly 
      specialized tools. From contributions to software ecosystems like MySQL, Android, and 
      Bitcoin to advancing developer productivity and cloud infrastructure with gRPC, Envoy, 
      and LeakCanary, our work has had a lasting impact. Our philosophy is not only about using 
      open source but actively giving back and shaping itâ€”enhancing projects we depend on and 
      sharing our own innovations with the world. This approach aligns with our mission of 
      economic empowerment by fostering transparency, security, and accessibility in technology.
