        By collaborating in the open, we create higher quality software, hardware, 
        and protocols through relentless collective examination, and also ensure our systems, 
        hardware, and protocols evolve to meet real-world needs.

        We are committed to building solutions that serve our customers, while enriching the 
        broader developer community with open, accessible tools. Our open source strategy 
        emphasizes transparency, collaboration, and shared progressâ€”because building together 
        empowers everyone.
